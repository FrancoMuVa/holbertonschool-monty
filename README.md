# Preface
As usual, I Patricio "Kindness" Coiti√±o, will redact the README of this wonderful project.
Franco Musso is the main writer of the code and I have provided guidance over the matters, but it would be beneath me to lie: Franco's coding skills are natural and great.
But, as any other coder he had some, small, issues regarding pointers and linked lists. Small enough to go under his radar but not mine, thus my production in this project.

# The Monty Interpreter
An interpreter for the Monty language, one language pretty easy for the means of creating an interpreter.
This work would prove to be easy, for the kind of project (interpreter), but harder than it seamed. The idea is simple: a program that reads line by line and processes what is being asked of it and then executes those commands.
In practice, we got really confused with it.
